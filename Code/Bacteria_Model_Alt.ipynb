    "How does microbial ecosystem structure and functioning respond to warming and disturbance (e.g. chemical pollution such as pesticides or antibiotics)? \n",
    "\n",
    "We develop a mathematical model to investigate the response of ecosystems/communities of interacting bacterial populations to address this. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we derive and describe the model, and analyze it with the objective of determining how systems of multiple interacting bacteria with different functional traits (e.g. size, type of response to warming, or the thermal performance curves (TPC) resource preference) are self-organized or \"selected\" by species sorting under different environment conditions. We are particularly interested in which bacterial traits/strategies maximize ecosystem functioning (e.g., carbon flux, biomass production, or total respiration), and which consistently emerge through interaction-driven assembly and turnover dynamics. \n",

    "# The Model\n",
    "\n",
    "We build on / modify the mathematical model proposed by [Marsland et al. (2019)](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006793), which is itself based on the seminal Rosenzweig-MacArthur consumer-resource equations. \n",
    "\n",
    "The model consists of coupled ODEs representing one or more consumers (bacteria) feeding on one or more carbon resources. The resources are substrates in the from of particulate or dissolved organic carbon substrates (POC and DOC, respectively). Each bacterial population can feed on a specific set of resources, and a portion of any given resource consumed by any given bacterial population is necessarily converted into one or more other resources during the process of sequestration and / or allocation to maintenance and growth by the population. \n",

    "Growth respiration here represents the loss of carbon due to the thermodynamic limits (inefficiency) of processing and assimilating carbon sources ([Gommers et al. 1988](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/bit.260320112)). Maintenance respiration represents the costs of processes such as protein and nucleic acid turnover, osmo-regulation and cell movement ([Chapman & Grey 1986](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0038071786900957)). In theory, separating these two types of respiration is desirable for two reasons. First, in cells that are not in any sort of stationary phase, $R_m$ is arguably independent of carbon uptake such that carbon loss from maintenance is proportional to the amount of metabolically active biomass, because maintenance activities continue irrespective of whether carbon uptake is occurring. Second, as growth respiration rate is associated with assimilating/allocating carbon into biomass, it should be related to the magnitude of uptake. However, in practice, differentiating between these two types of respiratory carbon losses is impossible, because these processes effectively occur simultaneously in the ODE system, the time delay between cessation of uptake and maintenance activities may actually be insignificant, and in any case, the two types of respiration are indistinguishable in typical laboratory experiments.\n",

    "\n",
    "Furthermore, leakage of carbon substrates to the environment also occurs via the release of multiple substrates as bacteria break one or more substrates into others, which can be expressed as the sum of losses across $M$ substrates, i.e., for the $j^{th}$ substrate,\n",

These cross-substrate leakages allow the commonly-seen cross-feeding microbial interactions to be represented in the dynamics. \n",

    "\n",
    "Given the above model for growth of a bacterial species population, the model for resource dynamics follows fairly naturally from the population dynamics by enforcing mass conservation. As with bacterial carbon biomass, the amount of the $j^{th}$ resource  in the environment must be determined by the rate at which it enters ($I$) minus the rate at which it leaves ($D$):\n",

    "\n",
    "## Parameterizations and Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "So there are 4 main parameters that we need for this model:\n",
    "1. Uptake matrix\n",
    "2. Maintenance Respiration\n",
    "3. Growth Respiration\n",
    "4. Carbon transition matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "We now consider the issue of obtaining values or estimates for each of these parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Uptake\n",
    "\n",
    "So we cannot really obtain estimates of uptake directly but we can may be able to use Tom Smith's data to get estimates of the magnitude relative to total respiration?\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of structure of the matrix we can vary the nestedness of the interactions (changing the strength of interaction in the community).\n",
    "\n",
    "Temperature should directly affect uptake as it is related to the activity of enzymes and the transport of substrates across the cell wall, at a minimum the rate of passive diffusion should increase. It's hard to know how to parameterise this individually though... There is some evidence that microbes switch metabolic pathways with temperature, this can be represented though the alteration of the relative uptake rates. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Maintainence Respiration\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a fairly large body of work considering the importance of microbial maintenence respiration with various models and experiments aiming to understand its dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "We may be able to estimate the amount of respiration that originates from this process in relation to the total respiration of a given population by using these papers. For example [Price & Sowers (2004)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC384798/) estimate the ratio of metabolic rates for bacteria in growth and maintence phases to be $10^3 : 1$. We need to look at more papers for this as this ratio seems very high.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same paper also looks at the temperature dependence of metabolism across these two phases, finding no difference. This could be very helpful as it indicates that the total respiratory temperature dependence should be equal to the temperature dependence of each part individually...\n",
    "\n",
    "## Growth respiration\n",
    "\n",
    "As it stands in the model, growth respiration is the fixed proportion of each carbon source that is lost as $CO_2$ when it is metabolised. Thus, it takes the form of a vector with length $M$. In theory we can set a limit to the values in this vector based on the fact that the metabolism of many carbon sources will not allow total conversion of carbon mass. This should hold true for more complex carbon substrates though the proportion respired should increase as the molecules get more simple (i.e. i imagine the consumption of something simple like glucose should be relatively straightforward and efficient). \n",
    "\n",
    "This point is backed up by the work of [Gommers et al. (1988)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/bit.260320112) who estimate that around $12\\%-29\\%$ of substrate is released as $CO_2$ during metabolism (A nice range to work with?).\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of temperature dependence the proportion of carbon respired per unit input should not change with temperature (i.e. $p_g$ above) though the supply of material to metabolise (via the uptake term) will. \n",
    "\n",
    "## $l$ - the substrate transition matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "Though this matrix is impossible to directly parameterize, we can make some assumptions about its structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly we can assume that its entries are independent of temperature. As this parameter represents the conversion of the uptake of one form of carbon into others it will be constrained by the biochemical pathways that are used in the metabolism of the carbon source. Thus, unless the metabolic pathways change themselves (which there actually is some evidence for ): ) the entries of $l$ will remain the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also make some assumptions about the structure of $l$. As the transitions between carbon sources represent biochemical reactions we can assume some kind of directionality in the reactions as complex substrates are broken down into more simple ones. This can be interpreted in terms of the entropy production in these reactions.\n",
