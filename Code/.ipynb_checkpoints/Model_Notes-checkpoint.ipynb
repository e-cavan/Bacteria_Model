    "How does microbial ecosystem structure and functioning respond to warming and disturbance (e.g. chemical pollution such as pesticides or antibiotics)? \n",
    "\n",
    "We develop a mathematical model to investigate the response of ecosystems/communities of interacting bacterial populations to address this. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we derive and describe the model, and analyze it with the objective of determining how systems of multiple interacting bacteria with different functional traits (e.g. size, type of response to warming, or the thermal performance curves (TPC) resource preference) are self-organized or \"selected\" by species sorting under different environment conditions. We are particularly interested in which bacterial traits/strategies maximize ecosystem functioning (e.g., carbon flux, biomass production, or total respiration), and which consistently emerge through interaction-driven assembly and turnover dynamics. \n",
    "\n",
    "# The Model\n",
    "\n",
    "We build on / modify the mathematical model proposed by [Marsland et al. (2019)](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006793), which is itself based on the seminal Rosenzweig-MacArthur consumer-resource equations. \n",
    "\n",
    "The model consists of coupled ODEs representing one or more consumers (bacteria) feeding on one or more carbon resources. The resources are substrates in the from of particulate or dissolved organic carbon substrates (POC and DOC, respectively). Each bacterial population can feed on a specific set of resources, and a portion of any given resource consumed by any given bacterial population is necessarily converted into one or more other resources during the process of sequestration and / or allocation to maintenance and growth by the population. \n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by deriving the multi-species community/ecosystem model from fundamental processes and assumptions. \n",
    "\n",
    "## A Basic Population Growth Model\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with the fact that the carbon biomass growth rate of the $i^{th}$ bacterial population biomass ($C_i$) must be given by the gain of carbon ($U$) minus loss ($D$) rates (both in units of (carbon) mass $\\times$ time$^{-1}$):\n",
    "\n",

    "    \\frac{1}{C_i}\\frac{dC_i}{dt} = U_i - D_i\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that $U$ as such is not a scalar, but a function that depends on the availability of growth-limiting nutrients such as N and P, which we assume henceforth to be abundantly available in the growth medium. For example, $U$ may be of the Michaelis-Menten form $U = \\frac{\\mu_{max}}{K+N}$, where $\\mu_{max}$ is nutrient-unlimited, maximal uptake and growth rate, $K$ is the half-saturation constant, and $N$ is the limiting nutrient. Then, $\\lim_{N\\to\\infty} U \\to \\mu_{max}$, i.e., effectively, $U = \\mu_{max}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can separate the loss term $D$ into carbon lost due to respiration $R$ (i.e. as $\\text{CO}_2$), and that lost/released/leaked back into the environment/medium as organic substrate ($L$) as well as cell mortality ($z$):\n",

    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "We can further partition the respiratory loss $R$ into the cost of maintenance ($R_m$) and that which occurs as a result of growth $R_g$ (Manzoni & Porporato ([2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038071709000765))), i.e., \n",

    "Growth respiration here represents the loss of carbon due to the thermodynamic limits (inefficiency) to processing and assimilating carbon sources ([Gommers et al. 1988](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/bit.260320112)). Maintenance respiration represents the costs of processes such as protein and nucleic acid turnover, osmo-regulation and cell movement ([Chapman & Grey 1986](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0038071786900957)). In theory, separating these two types of respiration is desirable, for two reasons. First, in cells that are not in any sort of stationary phase, $R_m$ is arguably independent of carbon uptake such that carbon loss from maintenance is proportional to the amount of metabolically active biomass, because maintenance activities continue irrespective of whether carbon uptake is occurring. Second, as growth respiration rate is associated with assimilating/allocating carbon into biomass, it should be related to the magnitude of uptake (e.g., $R_g = f(U) = \\varepsilon U$, where $\\varepsilon$ is a proportion representing growth or carbon allocation efficiency). However, in practice, differentiating between these two types of respiratory carbon losses is impossible, both, because these processes effectively occur simultaneously in the ODE system, and are indistinguishable using standard empirical/laboratory experiments.    \n",

    "\n",
    "As the growth respiration $R_g$ rates and the loss of carbon to the environment $L$ are dependent on uptake, we can assume that their values will vary across the $M$ carbon substrates. We can indicate this by rewriting the population growth equation as:\n",

    "## Parameterizations and Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "So there are 4 main parameters that we need for this model:\n",
    "1. Uptake matrix\n",
    "2. Maintenance Respiration\n",
    "3. Growth Respiration\n",
    "4. Carbon transition matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "We now consider the issue of obtaining values or estimates for each of these parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Uptake\n",
    "\n",
    "So we cannot really obtain estimates of uptake directly but we can may be able to use Tom Smith's data to get estimates of the magnitude relative to total respiration?\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of structure of the matrix we can vary the nestedness of the interactions (changing the strength of interaction in the community).\n",
    "\n",
    "Temperature should directly affect uptake as it is related to the activity of enzymes and the transport of substrates across the cell wall, at a minimum the rate of passive diffusion should increase. It's hard to know how to parameterise this individually though... There is some evidence that microbes switch metabolic pathways with temperature, this can be represented though the alteration of the relative uptake rates. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Maintainence Respiration\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a fairly large body of work considering the importance of microbial maintenence respiration with various models and experiments aiming to understand its dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "We may be able to estimate the amount of respiration that originates from this process in relation to the total respiration of a given population by using these papers. For example [Price & Sowers (2004)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC384798/) estimate the ratio of metabolic rates for bacteria in growth and maintence phases to be $10^3 : 1$. We need to look at more papers for this as this ratio seems very high.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same paper also looks at the temperature dependence of metabolism across these two phases, finding no difference. This could be very helpful as it indicates that the total respiratory temperature dependence should be equal to the temperature dependence of each part individually...\n",
    "\n",
    "## Growth respiration\n",
    "\n",
    "As it stands in the model, growth respiration is the fixed proportion of each carbon source that is lost as $CO_2$ when it is metabolised. Thus, it takes the form of a vector with length $M$. In theory we can set a limit to the values in this vector based on the fact that the metabolism of many carbon sources will not allow total conversion of carbon mass. This should hold true for more complex carbon substrates though the proportion respired should increase as the molecules get more simple (i.e. i imagine the consumption of something simple like glucose should be relatively straightforward and efficient). \n",
    "\n",
    "This point is backed up by the work of [Gommers et al. (1988)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/bit.260320112) who estimate that around $12\\%-29\\%$ of substrate is released as $CO_2$ during metabolism (A nice range to work with?).\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of temperature dependence the proportion of carbon respired per unit input should not change with temperature (i.e. $p_g$ above) though the supply of material to metabolise (via the uptake term) will. \n",
    "\n",
    "## $l$ - the substrate transition matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "Though this matrix is impossible to directly parameterize, we can make some assumptions about its structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly we can assume that its entries are independent of temperature. As this parameter represents the conversion of the uptake of one form of carbon into others it will be constrained by the biochemical pathways that are used in the metabolism of the carbon source. Thus, unless the metabolic pathways change themselves (which there actually is some evidence for ): ) the entries of $l$ will remain the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also make some assumptions about the structure of $l$. As the transitions between carbon sources represent biochemical reactions we can assume some kind of directionality in the reactions as complex substrates are broken down into more simple ones. This can be interpreted in terms of the entropy production in these reactions.\n",

    "* When the bacteria do not compete (N = M) and have the same $Ea$ (Scenario 2a) the equilibria bacterial mass can be found by dividing the analystical solution by 2. This is constant across all $Eas$. When the $Ea$ are different, there is no obvious connection between the simulated and analytical equilibria. Further, the highest $Ea$ has the highest bacteria mass which contradicts all previous work and runs of the vectorised model.\n",
    "* When bacteria do not compete but only one has access to an external resource input (Scenario 3a) then the bacterial mass is 72 \\% of the analytical solution when $\\rho$ = 1 and 28 % of the solution when $\\rho$ = 0. This is when the $Ea$ are the same. When the $Ea$ are different (Scenario 3b), the one with the resource input wins and as of yet there is no relationship between the bacteria with 0 external input of resources and the analytical solution but could be related to the relative difference in $Ea$.\n",
    "* When there are no external resource inputs all bacteria die as predicted by the analytical solution but the solution cannot predict the resource mass. It is unlikely this scenario (Scenario 4a or b) will be relevant in nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When not competiting for resources the lowest Ea wins, when competiting for resources the highest Ea wins**\n",
    "\n",
    "**When only one resources has an external input then that resource wins, although others with a higher $Ea$ will do well too. Further down the chain the nutrients become depleted - is this representative of a natural system?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Perhaps to introduce cross-feeding we make different functional groups which have one external nutrient and they cross feed amongst themselves - a chain is not realistic of nature**\n",

This is because a larger size could increase genome increasing growth rate, but could also increase maintenance respiration ($R_{m,i}$) which would negatively impact on growth rates and population size. Instead of forcing size to have a positive or negative impact on population size both these relationships can be incorporated into the model. As body size increases, $u_{ij}$ will rise, increasing uptake and have a positive impact on population growth. $R_{m,i}$ will also increase with body size, but this is a loss term from the bacteria consumer so decreases overall population growth. $B$ for $u_{ij}$ (growth, $Bg$) will be higher than for $R_{m,i}$ (respiration, $Brm$)."
